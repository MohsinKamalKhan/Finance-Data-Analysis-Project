# 💰 Finance Data Analysis Project

A data analysis project focused on stock performance and financial metrics of major companies using historical stock price data and interactive visualizations.

## 📄 One-Line Description

> Analyze and visualize financial stock data of major companies to uncover trends, correlations, and investment insights using Python.

## 📁 Project Structure

* `Finance Project.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook with all analysis and visualizations.
* `.pkl` file: Contains preprocessed stock data (hosted on GitHub – see below).

## 🔗 Dataset

* The project uses historical stock data of major companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, etc.).
* Preprocessed `.pkl` file is hosted on GitHub and should be loaded into the notebook for analysis.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – for data handling
* **NumPy** – for numerical operations
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** – for static plotting
* **Plotly** – for interactive visualizations

## 📈 Key Features

* Load stock data using a `.pkl` file
* Explore basic financial metrics (Open, Close, Volume, etc.)
* Compare stock performance visually
* Calculate and visualize moving averages
* Correlation heatmaps between different companies
* Risk-return plots and standard deviation comparisons

## 🔧 How to Use

1. Clone this repository or download the notebook.
2. Download the `.pkl` data file from your GitHub repo and place it in the working directory.
3. Run the notebook in Jupyter Lab or any Python environment that supports `plotly` and `matplotlib`.

## 🧪 Sample Analysis

* Line plots comparing stock closing prices
* Rolling 30-day mean visualizations
* Risk (volatility) vs Return scatter plots
* Heatmaps showing correlation between different stock prices

## 📎 Notes

* Interactive Plotly graphs require running in an environment that supports JavaScript rendering (e.g., Jupyter Lab).
* Ensure all required packages (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `plotly`) are installed.

## 📚 References

* Data collected and pickled in `.pkl` format for fast loading and analysis.
* Historical stock data sourced via APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, though not shown here).
